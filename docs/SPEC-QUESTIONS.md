# Open questions for the Otter language specification

Things found while porting otterPS to C# where otterPS's code and its own
documentation disagree, or where behaviour is unspecified. otter-net copies
otterPS's **code** exactly - what users get today - until Jeff decides the
question in otterPS's `SPEC-DECISIONS.md`; then both implementations follow.

## Q1. `months between` across a shorter month end (found 2026-10-15)

`Measure-OtterDateDifference` in `src/Otter.Interpreter.psm1` (D32.7) says in
its comment "Calendar months, not averaged days: Jan 31 to Feb 28 is one
month", but the code counts a month only when the end day is at least the
start day:

    months between date from "2024-01-31" and date from "2024-02-28"   # 0

The same rule makes `years between` 2000-06-15 and 2026-06-14 equal 25.

**Status:** behaviour unchanged in both implementations (Jeff, 2026-10-16).
Needs a decision: either the comment is wrong (keep the code, fix the
comment), or the code is (count Jan 31 -> Feb 28/29 as one month, which
changes results for existing programs).
Covered by `tests/compat/dates.ot`.
